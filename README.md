# Object-Oriented-Pros
This is a repository specifically for showcasing Object Oriented Designs, Patterns and Principles. 

One of the big hurdles in practicing Object-Oriented is finding problems to practice. This repository solves that problem.

Interesting problems will be shared in this repository for practicing, and would ask contributors to colleborate so that others can see, discuss, get design ideas to learn, practice and get better.

Finding the right designs and choices are always personal, and are open ended topics. Different people have different preferences.
